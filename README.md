## About The Project

Welcome! <br>
This repo is the port to .NET of the following course <br>
<a href="https://codigofacilito.com/cursos/patrones-diseno">Patrones de Diseño en Java - CodigoFacilito</a> <br>
The course covers all the 23 Design Patterns in the GoF - “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software” <br>
<b>This is a repo created just for learning purposes, and you are free to use it however you want!</b>

#

## Built With

The proyect is build entirely in the .NET Core platform. <br>
[![.NET][net-badge]][net-url]

#

## Proyect Structure
The proyect is divided in folders representing the types of Design Patterns
- Behavioral
- Structural
- Creational

After that, every pattern is in its own folder.

#

## Considerations

The proyect has some patterns that use the same classes names, thats why some usings are commented (to avoid errors). <br>
It's pending to correct that and make the project work regardless of that.
